thesis
======
Since this is a thesis about a new paradigm of writing research publications, it does not make sense to write this thesis in an old fashioned way.

Software packages that are not version controlled from the very beginning are hard to understand. The extreme situation is the authors upload the final code, all at once, to the public repository. No one can track the authors' development process in this situation.

For a paper, this might be not that serious, but it still helps a lot if the whole writing process is public, in addition to the final product. In this way readers get to know how the authors develop, deny, adapt and merge ideas over time.
