\specialhead{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

I would like to thank Peter Fox for his advise and encouragements throughout the process of the research presented in this thesis. I would also like to thank Xiaogang Ma for his contribution of time and insights as a domain scientist in the ontology design of PROV-PUB-O and the ontology usability evaluation method development.

I would also like to thank my wife, Wenyu Li, for her love and care and encouragements during the last two years. This work would be impossible without her company.
