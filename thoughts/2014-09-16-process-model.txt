Writing during headache? Let's try and see what will happen. PROV-PUB-O has the structural part, such as chapters, sections, etc, rhetoric concepts such as introduction, abstract in DoCO, the Document Components Ontology, in my view, should be properties instead of classes. Since they are roles of paragraphs, sentences, chapters, etc. Just like "dc:title" is a property instead of a class. PROV-PUB-O also has the process part, which I haven't thought of yet. Should be based on PROV-O. Let's brainstorm for the process part NOW! I feel much better for my headache now! What are the process model elements? What are the actions the authors take to produce publications? Or it really should be what actions a reader or an author should take to reproduce the publication? Authors can take various approaches to the first publication -- They can write a mess, cut, copy, paste, reorder to get the first draft, then create figures and tables and read related work from time to time. Other authors may prefer to read related work a lot in the beginning, write the related work part of the paper first, then the introduction part, before starting to do experiments and create tables and figures to report the results. But during the reproduction phase, a natural order is preferred: a publication is reproduced according to its final appearance: front matters, introduction, approach, evaluation, discussion, related work, references. A sequential action sequence leads to the final production -- the publication. No iterations of editing for manuscripts, no tweaking of parameters for experiments and visualizations, no fine-tuning of table contents and formatting. So for the purpose of reproducing the publication, only one set of parameters should be recorded as provenance, likewise only one version of manuscripts and only one set of layouts for columns, tables, etc. in the publication.
