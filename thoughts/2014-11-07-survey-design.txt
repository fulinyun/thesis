use a website to collect data from earth scientists to validate my hypotheses. can I get data from scientists in other domains?

and think about collecting people's opinions.

how can we collect opinions from those busy scientists? I ignore surveys. they just ask for my opinions and don't give me anything. review an ontology? impossible. what can a survey bring to the survey takers? statistical information of past survey takers.
