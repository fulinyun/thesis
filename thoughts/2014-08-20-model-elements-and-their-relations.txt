To model PROV-PUB, the specific provenance model for research publications, I hope to utilize existing related models: latex syllabus elements such as titles, chapters, figures, sections, subsections, subsubsections; ecoop ontology we have from discussions, which has chapters, authors, datasets, etc. Recognizing model elements in this way may lead to incomplete models. I will pay attention to all related work I will read to see if there are any additional elements to add to the model.

Return to the publication preparation process, an author writes manuscripts, then decides to insert a graph to illustrate an idea, he will use a certain piece of data and a certain piece of software to generate the graph. What are the elements and relations to capture here? We have part-of relations: a figure is part of a chapter, a paragraph is a part of a subsubsection, a part of a subsection, a part of a section, a part of a chapter, a part of a paper/article/report/book. We have use-work-on-generate relations: the author uses a piece of software to work on a piece of data to generate a figure.
