so two points in this proposal: research reproducibility and ontology evaluation. 
How are these two related? well research reproducibility and the trend (timeline of the papers 
I reviewed), really reproducible research requires a common provenance ontology that is 
expressive enough to record information detailed enough for replication of computational 
experiments. An ontology useful and usable has more chance to become the common ontology.

authors on research reproducibility have the implicit indication that reproducibility inevitably
takes pain to achieve. my work is trying to show that this pain can actually be relieved.
