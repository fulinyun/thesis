The starting and ending times of activities do not matter in the context of research paper preparation. Authors can prepare all the images first, then insert them into proper places in between manuscripts later, or postpone the figure production after the manuscript writing, or switch between manuscript writing and figure/image/table preparation a lot during the paper writing process. In other words, the order of writing manuscripts, editing them, preparing figures and tables and listings, etc. is highly interchangeable. So the use of starting and ending times of activities are not encouraged in modeling research publication provenance.

unless the execution of an activity depends on the results of another activity. so the second activity must finish before the starting time of the first activity. so starting and ending times are important provenance for activities, but just in the sense of ordering them. i.e., the specific times are not interesting, but the temporal order of activities' happenings matters. Specific times are more than sufficient information for replicating experiments and guarantee the success of replication by following the temporal order of activities. Software agents are often not aware of what resources a certain activity depends on. runtime checks cause failure -- "trial and error" approach
