The starting and ending times of activities do not matter in the context of research paper preparation. Authors can prepare all the images first, then insert them into proper places in between manuscripts later, or postpone the figure production after the manuscript writing, or switch between manuscript writing and figure/image/table preparation a lot during the paper writing process. In other words, the order of writing manuscripts, editing them, preparing figures and tables and listings, etc. is highly interchangeable. So the use of starting and ending times of activities are not encouraged in modeling research publication provenance.
