use subclasses of bib:Entry to describe pub:Document types.

pub:Document, pub:Chapter, pub:Section are container of pub:Figure and pub:Table, not necessarily prov:Entity

r data structures are intermediate entities (subclasses of prov:Entity), it seems nobody has created an ontology for R data structures, i could create a fairly primitive one as a plug-in for prov-pub-o.

directory and url should be properties of dataset instances, instead of classes.
