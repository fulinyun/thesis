steps in a typical data analysis (from r in action p4)
1 import data
2 prepare, explore and clean data
3 fit a statistical model -- calculate the parameter values of the model
4 evaluate the model fit -- with metrics such as the sum of squared errors
5 cross-validate the model -- with different slices of data?
6 evaluate model prediction on new data -- with a certain fitness metric
7 produce report
