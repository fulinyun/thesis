so what I would like to write to Christian Dane Schenkelberg (schenc3@rpi.edu), whom I met at yesterday's poster session?

he is the IT guy who tries to make a piece of software work for their computational process. I wanna ask him what are the difficulties he has met while he tried to make the software work. It's kind of like the current status survey: how hard it is to reuse someone else's software, would a replicable computational experiment help? To implement the replicability, how should my system deal with the dependences to libraries in python and other languages? If the IPython Notebook relies on a file that is generated by a certain piece of software, the notebook itself will not be able to capture the provenance of that file. Unless the software is invoked via the notebook.

Oh I should really start playing with ipython notebook A LOT! I know how to run shell/command line scripts via ipython notebook, notebooks are also able to run R code. 

back to the email to christian, i think i could start with asking him what the authors of the original paper with the reused algorithm could do to make the reuse of their code easier for him. what are the detailed questions? does the language matter? prefer python or R? is a dependence inventory important? virtual machine image helpful? documentation? looks like what are the factors that affect the ease of reuse of a piece of software.

without any funding for collaborative research between science and informatics practitioners, it is hard for me to work with scientists since scientists are not compensated on the time they spent with me. unless they believe I can actually save them more time on reusing software than the time they spent working with me.
