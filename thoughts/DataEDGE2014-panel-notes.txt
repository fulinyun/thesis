Why do we like reproducibility?

- provides (a way to generate) evidence of correctness
- enables re-use, modification, extension, ...
- exposes methods, which might be interesting and instructive
- gut feeling that transparency and openness are good

claim: reproducibility is a tool, not a primary goal.

might accomplish some of these goals without it, but it's a very powerful tool.

--Philip Stark from UC Berkeley


"really reproducible research" inspired by Stanford Professor Jon Claerbout:
"The idea is: an article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete ... set of instructions [and data] which generated the figures."
--David Donoho, 1998.
