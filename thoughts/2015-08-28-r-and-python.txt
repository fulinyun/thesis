i wanna check if doco:Image exists, for a figure may contain several images with different provenance. "which image" labels could easily be dc(terms) annotations.

the real big issue is about r and python, [benestad 2015] provides complete code in r to reproduce 38 contrarian papers on global warming research. how will the code work with ipython notebook? i could image a SemanticChange instance has something like a sequentially ordered steps encoded in the form of rdf:List(?), each step needs to point out its running environment such as its running platform and dependencies.

"executable" means unambiguous. the description given by an executable provenance graph should describe the process precisely without any ambiguity. the process is potentially automatable, but not necessarily automated now.

about granularity of process steps. in [benestad 2015 supporting material], Humlum.et.al.2011() is the r function call for the whole process of the computations performed in [Hunlum 2011]. we certainly want more fine-grained step descriptions. it is up to the author (and peer reviewers) to decide which granularity level is appropriate.

attributes(gisp2)["url"] is the source from which the data were obtained, and attributes(gisp2)["date"] the date.
