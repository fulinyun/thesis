about metrics of success
is the "useful and usable" result based on 5 evaluators' review a valid sign of success?

wide spreading is not a good metrics either, since it does not necessarily mean good quality of the ontology.
so we cannot say that the ontology is successful because it is now being used by this many researchers/projects.


what can this work bring to the community?


scope of this work? a single user edits a part of a publication should be the simplest scenario.
