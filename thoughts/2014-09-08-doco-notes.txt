The Pattern Ontology
Describing documents by means of their structural components -- I'll just call it a pattern ontology for document structure

based on patterns for XML documents -- Does each of the elements below have a counterpart in my model for research publications? Are these classes applicable to research publications?

structured elements can contain other elements.

non-structured elements cannot contain other elements.

textual element can have textual content in their content models.

non-textual element cannot have textual content in their content models.

marker elements can contain neither text nodes nor elements.

flat elements can contain text nodes but no elements.

bucket elements can contain other elements but no text nodes.

atom elements can contain textual content and no other elements.

atom elements are disjoint with field elements.

field elements are defined to literal metadata or text that is not really part of the document body.


discourse elements ontology and SALT (semantically annotated latex) framework \cite{groza2007salt} both present the idea of rhetoric elements and how they reside in the rhetorical structure of a document. 

rhetorical structure theory: It
explains coherence by postulating a hierarchical, connected structure of texts, in which
every part of a text has a role, a function to play, with respect to other parts in the text. \cite{taboada2006rhetorical}
