The idea of specializing an ontology for a specific usage is so important yet so often under-valued. The Linked Data API, for example, is good enough to implement any RESTful-to-SPARQL services but a common usage of LDA is using it for vocabulary service, and a lot of duplicated efforts are made to define commonly seen vocabulary services, so actually a Linked Vocabulary API, defined based on LDA but with many preset services, is in need here. It saves a lot of efforts from the service providers' side in terms of learning LDA and defining vocabulary services. So just that something can be done does not mean that there is no more work to do here. There is still a lot of work to do to make the job easier to get done with customized specialization of some general enabling system. In light of this theory, I am defining PROV-PUB, a specialization of PROV specifically tailored to fit the needs of modeling the preparation process of research publications.
