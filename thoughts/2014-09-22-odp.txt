typology of OPs, meaning classification of OPs?
patterns: background, definition, communication means? related work beyond ontology engineering, exemplification, creation, usage principles.
what are tasks expressed as competency questions or scenarios?

what is a concrete example of an ontology design pattern? use a qualified class to describe properties of a property? 

a competency question is a typical query that an expert might want to submit to a knowledge base of its target domain for a certain task. -- query, domain, task
.

the time indexed person role CP is a specialization of the n-ary property CP in my view. A person plays a certain role during a certain period of time, so the period of time is a property of the plays-the-role-of property. QualifiedRole is another possible solution to the task. I prefer the qualified role solution since it does not require creating a class for a property. It just enhances an existing class to enable it to contain more information.
