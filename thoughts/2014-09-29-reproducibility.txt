maybe important but not quite capturable or helpful in reproducing the results: the details of the computational environments. No one is likely to reproduce the exact same environment. Exposing such environments via Web services would be useful. Portable computational environments such as Python Virtual Environments supported by the tool virtualenv would be really helpful. The readers are not restricted by the functions provided by the Web services created by someone else. They have the full control of their computational environments. Two important credibility tests: exact same environment as the authors used, absolute freedom on what to do in the environment.

so reproducibiliy does not merely mean readers can reproduce the exact same result as reported in the publication, it rather means that readers get a compatible environment as the authors used to produce the reported results and are free to do whatever they want with that environment, including reproducing exactly the same results as reported in the publication.
