so what order should i follow to compose the introduction chapter?
i can say what provenance means in this thesis first, 
then how important provenance is to the research publication readers, and then how difficult and anti-motivated its capturing is to the authors, stating the authoring workflow here. 
Say that currently authors lack both the ability and the motivation to capture provenance for their publications, given the currently available tools. 
Argue that it is possible to develop tools to alleviate the situation. 
Point out the challenges of developing such tools.
- ontology for publication provenance
- provenance capturing mechanism that requires authors to do as little as possible and captures as much as possible provenance information
- The implementation of the mechanism on a system independent platform.
State that in this thesis, we will:
- propose an ontology for publication provenance
- propose a provenance capturing mechanism that requires less knowledge and efforts from the authors than currently required.
- implement a platform realizing the mechanism.

the importance of provenance shows when some reader would like to validate or reproduce the reported results. reproduce and validate are closely related. in the narrow meaning, reproducibility means being able to recreate the exact same results as reported in the publication. In a wider sense, reproducibility means being able to recreate the computational environment used by the authors to get the reported results.

what provenance means in this thesis:
 - pointers to the source data, such as downloading URLs and landing Web pages describing the source data, along with operational information such as the filtering, calibrating, analyzing, and aggregating operations performed on the source data to lead to the final reported results. But how about the human contributors? owner? contributor? originator? people responsible? 
 - (optional) a computational environment enabling the same set or a superset of the operations leading to the reported results. This environment does not provide any more information, but it saves readers' efforts to implement the operations, so it is optional but desirable. It is also desirable that this environment has a certain degree of flexibility, by allowing readers to perform something different from the sequence of operations leading to the reported results. 

The environment could consist of a set of programs ready to run, or library functions ready to be used by programs invoking them.

plenty of evidences and arguments showing that provenance is important

why authors lack motivation to capture it, 

reproducibility, a computational environment that is compatible with the one used by the authors to generate the results. compatible meaning ability to perform the same set of operations on data as the authors performed. Authors may use a specific computational environment, readers are likely to use a different environment, but as long as operations keep their semantics, the two environments are considered compatible.

possible to develop tools to alleviate the situation:
All provenance information is actually available. it gets lost if not recorded in a timely manner. Based on the operation+environment model, specifications of an operation may be recorded in a configuration file, in which case they are available until the configuration file is modified for another application of the operation. specifications may also be just input on the screen by authors as command line arguments, in which case they get lost immediately if the authors don't proactively note them down.


time-of-creation to time-of-recording gap
