delta based data version tracking is not that effective for transformations.
operational delta could be effective, but need a unified operation model to represent and manage changes.
snapshot can be combined with (operational) delta to save milestones.

source code are easy to track when no restructuring and reformatting are involved.

when dataset changes, supporting tools also need to change.

DOIs work because there's an infrastructure.
