policy = decision making -- whether to allow access, whether to allow performing a certain operation, whether to 
issue documents to people, whether the quality of service reaches a certain level, whether a person is eligible to 
receive certain rewards...

policy is also rules and triggers -- if-then-else rules such as certain events must be logged, a user must change his/her 
password when something happens, 

in short, policy is making decisions and take actions during the decision making process.

"policies act both as decision support systems and as
declarative behavior specifications"

trust management: decide the requester is trusted or not, and thus the service is allowed or denied.

reputation calculation: ratings, no certifying authorities.

in the area of research publications, decisions are whether to accept research papers, whether to make the paper/
its associated scripts public/accessible to certain groups of people. 

Currently process recording for every figure in a paper is usually not required due to 1) the burden it brings to the authors, and 2) the extra 
workload on the reviewers' side. To clear the burden, the recording and reviewing of figure generation processes need to be easy for both authors 
and reviewers, or even better to be fully automatic. 

valid provenance for figures and tables could be a factor for the consideration towards, or even a prerequisite for the acceptance of papers.
