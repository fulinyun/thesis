Latex is the de facto research publication authoring software / generator, A lot of Journals / periodics / conferences provide LaTeX template for authors who intend to submit manuscripts (examples? this thesis is written based on a LaTeX template). These templates are specializations of the general LaTeX / TeX publication / paper model, with special settings/default parameter values for styles (cls). These specialization points include font family and font size, distance between lines and paragraphs, number of columns, figure/table formats, reference styles, etc. An authoring platform needs to accommodate this LaTeX style thinking mode.

Most research publications follow the same structure: each of them usually has a title, authors and their affiliations, an abstract, (front matters) an introductory section or chapter, content body consisting of problems, backgrounds, approaches, related work, evaluations, (do I wanna model these semantic elements? A paper talking about a new theory may have a very different set of such elements from one talking about some experimental results. Are there some common general elements across different types of papers? Currently I have the climate forcing paper which consists of introductory/background knowledge paragraphs, figure explanation paragraphs and discussion paragraphs. There might be a lot of names for the similar things: evaluation vs. experimental results vs. proof, approach to a problem vs. a model for a thing/phenomenon, I should try to gather as many general paper section / chapter titles as possible. "Related Work"/"Literature" should be a very popular title)
