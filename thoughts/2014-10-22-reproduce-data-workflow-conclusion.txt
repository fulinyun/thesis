reproduce data products for scientific research to use -- reproducibility of data products.
reproducibility of scientific conclusions -- perform different experiments to generate usually different data products to validate the same conclusion.
replicate experiments -- perform same sequence of operations on the same original data to get hopefully the same data product, namely the reported result.
reproduce data products and replicate experiments are both replicate data processing workflow
replicate environment
making it easy to verify data products
verify: actually did what they said they had done -- provenance can help
validate: what they did actually supports the conclusion they made -- provenance cannot help
