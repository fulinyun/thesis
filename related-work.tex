\cite{groth2009recording} presents five characteristics of provenance information, namely immutable, meaning intact after creation, attributable, meaning clear responsibility, autonomously creatable, meaning created by the most appropriate agent, finalizable, meaning clear timing of completeness, and process reflecting, meaning able to reflect the whole process leading to the final product.

\cite{miles2011prime} presents a provenance question driven methodology for provenance capturing.
